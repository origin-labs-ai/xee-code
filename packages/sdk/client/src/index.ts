/**
 * TypeScript client SDK for the Xee Harness Enhanced runtime: spawn the
 * `xhe-jsonrpc-agent` runtime as a subprocess and drive agent turns over
 * stdio JSON-RPC. `DeepSeekHarness` is the high-level run API;
 * `HarnessClient` is the lower-level protocol client. A pure library — it
 * registers nothing on a Cordis context; the runtime process it spawns is a
 * complete harness configured by its own `cordis.yml`.
