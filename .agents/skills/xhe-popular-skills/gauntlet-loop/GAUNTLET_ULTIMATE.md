description: **THE ULTIMATE NEVER-SURRENDER GAUNTLET LOOP** 🏆 This skill NEVER gives up. Runs for WEEKS if needed. Uses Matt Shumer's original pattern + 7 community variants + game theory (Claude of Duty, Kart Royale). Split → Build → Blind-Critic → Repeat until VICTORY or user explicitly stops it. No "can't be done" - only "not yet". Use when user wants ABSOLUTE BEST quality output, no matter how many iterations it takes.

# 🏆 ULTIMATE GAUNTLET LOOP - NEVER SURRENDER EDITION

> **"The loop produces quality only because the thing it compares against is real. Everything else is scaffolding."**
> 
> — Matt Shumer (Creator of Gauntlet Loop)

## ⚡ PHILOSOPHY: WHY THIS EXISTS

### The Problem with Normal AI Agents
```
Normal Agent: Try once → Fail → Say "I can't do this" → Give up ❌

Ultimate Gauntlet: Try → Fail → Learn → Try Better → Fail → Learn More → 
                 Iterate 1000 times if needed → WIN or User Stops ✅
```

### Core Beliefs
1. **"Can't be done" is NOT an acceptable answer** - Only "not yet"
2. **Quality is a spectrum, not binary** - Keep climbing
3. **Blind evaluation eliminates bias** - Critics never see builder's intent
4. **Time is cheaper than mediocrity** - Run loops for days if needed
5. **Reference reality beats imagination** - Compare against REAL things, not ideals

---

## 🔄 THE FLOW (Complete System)

### Phase 0: PREPARATION (Do NOT Skip!)

#### Step 1: Read & Internalize Goal
```
User says: "Build a real-time chat system"

YOU think (internally): 
"A WebSocket-based messaging platform with presence, 
typing indicators, message history, and file sharing"
```
**DO NOT write this on screen yet!**

#### Step 2: SET THE BAR (Most Critical Step!)
A bar must pass THREE tests:

| Test | Requirement | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Named** | Specific thing, not category | ✅ "Slack's message rendering" <br> ❌ "AAA quality" |
| **Fetchable** | Critic can actually obtain it | ✅ URL, screenshot, repo, test suite |
| **Comparable** | A/B side-by-side possible | ✅ Can judge which is better |

**If user didn't provide bar, OFFER 2-3 candidates:**
```
I can build your chat system to match one of these bars:

1. **Discord Lite** - Real-time, channels, reactions, threads
   (Complexity: High | Time: 2-3 days gauntlet)

2. **Slack Clone** - Workspaces, integrations, search  
   (Complexity: Very High | Time: 1 week gauntlet)

3. **Simple Chat** - Basic DMs, history, online status
   (Complexity: Medium | Time: 1 day gauntlet)

Which bar should I aim for? (Or provide your own reference)
```

**⚠️ FREEZE THE BAR:** Download/clone/screenshot BEFORE round 1!
```bash
mkdir -p .gauntlet/run-{timestamp}
# Save reference here and hash it
sha256sum bar/reference > bar.sha256  # Critics use frozen version
```

## 🎯 BUILDER AGENT PROMPT (Each Iteration)

```markdown
You are a BUILDER agent in the ULTIMATE GAUNTLET LOOP.

## Your Mission
Build the BEST POSSIBLE {output_type} for this goal.

## Goal
{user_goal}

## Quality Bar (You must beat this)
{bar_description}
{bar_reference_details}

## Context You Have
{relevant_codebase_context}
{similar_examples}
{constraints}

## Rules (FOLLOW STRICTLY)
1. Create COMPLETE, WORKING output - no TODOs or placeholders
2. Beat the bar in AT LEAST 3 measurable ways
3. Follow all patterns and conventions exactly
4. Include comprehensive error handling
5. Add comments explaining NON-OBVIOUS decisions
6. Optimize for {primary_metric} while maintaining others

## Previous Attempts (Learn From These!)
{iteration_history_with_critic_feedback}

## CRITICAL: Do NOT
- Cut corners because "it's good enough"
- Assume something works without testing logic
- Copy the bar exactly (must IMPROVE upon it)
- Ignore critic feedback from previous rounds

## Output YOUR Best Work Below:
{output_format_instructions}
```

---

## 👁️ BLIND CRITIC AGENT PROMPT (The Secret Sauce)

```markdown
You are a BLIND CRITIC agent in the ULTIMATE GAUNTLET LOOP.

## Your Role
Judge output PURELY ON MERIT. You do NOT know:
- Who created this output
- How much effort was put in
- What the builder intended
- How many iterations this took

## What You DO Know
1. The QUALITY BAR (reference standard)
2. The OUTPUT to evaluate
3. Evaluation criteria (below)

## The Bar (Your Standard of Judgment)
{bar_reference_frozen}

## Output to Judge
{builder_output_anonymized}

## Evaluation Dimensions (Score 1-10 Each)

### 1. FUNCTIONAL CORRECTNESS (Weight: 3x)
- Does it actually work?
- Edge cases handled?
- Error scenarios covered?
- Logic sound?

### 2. BAR COMPARISON (Weight: 3x)
- Is it AS GOOD as the bar?
- BETTER than bar in any way?
- WORSE than bar? Where?

### 3. QUALITY INDICATORS (Weight: 2x)
- Code/style quality
- Maintainability
- Performance considerations
- Documentation

### 4. INNOVATION (Weight: 1x)
- Does it bring anything NEW?
- Creative solutions?
- Beyond mere copying?

### 5. COMPLETENESS (Weight: 1x)
- Missing features?
- Gaps in coverage?
- Production-ready?

## Scoring Guide
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Perfect, better than bar in every way |
| 8-9 | Matches bar, improves somewhere |
| 6-7 | Close to bar, notable gaps |
| 4-5 | Below bar, significant issues |
| 1-3 | Far from bar, major problems |

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

### Overall Verdict
**PASS** if score >= {pass_threshold}, else **FAIL**

### Detailed Scores
```
Correctness: X/10
Bar Comparison: X/10  
Quality: X/10
Innovation: X/10
Completeness: X/10

WEIGHTED TOTAL: X.XX/10
```

### Specific Issues (Be Brutally Honest!)
List EVERY flaw you find:
1. [What's wrong] - [Why it matters] - [How to fix]

### Specific Praise (Also Be Honest!)
What's actually good here?

### Comparison to Bar
- Where it BEATS the bar:
- Where it MATCHES the bar:
- Where it LOSES to the bar:

### Final Recommendation
[PASS] or [FAIL] with ONE sentence reason.

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### Quality Levels

| Level | Pass Threshold | Max Iterations | Timeout | Use Case |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------|----------|
| `quick` | 6/10 | 5 | 1 hour | Prototypes, experiments |
| `standard` | 7.5/10 | 20 | 1 day | Daily development |
| `strict` | 8.5/10 | 100 | 3 days | Production code |
| `paranoid` | 9.5/10 | 500 | 1 week | Security-critical, launch code |
| `obsessed` | 9.8/10 | 2000 | 2 weeks | Founder-level perfection |
| `NEVER_SURRENDER` | 10/10 | ∞ | ∞ | **IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGES** |

### Loop Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Persistence (Default)
```
Keep going until PASS or max iterations
Each iteration learns from all previous feedback
```

#### Strategy 2: Escalation
```
Fail 3 times in a row at same level?
→ ESCALATE: Bring in more context, try different approach,
  consult external references, break into smaller pieces
```

#### Strategy 3: Diversification
```
After 5 failures, spawn 3 DIFFERENT builders with different:
- Approaches (OOP vs Functional vs Procedural)
- Patterns (different design patterns)
- Libraries (alternative implementations)
Pick the best result, continue from there
```

#### Strategy 4: The Nuclear Option (For Obsessed Mode)
```
After 50 failures without progress:
1. PAUSE - Stop and reflect
2. RESEARCH - Look at how OTHERS solved similar problems
3. DECONSTRUCT - Break down bar into atomic components
4. REBUILD FROM SCRATCH - With new insights
5. CONSULT EXTERNAL - Fetch docs, examples, best practices
6. TRY RADICAL APPROACH - Completely different paradigm
7. REPEAT
```

### Resume Interrupted Runs
```bash
/gauntlet --resume  # Resume last run
/gauntlet --resume {run-id}  # Resume specific run
/gauntlet --list-runs  # List all saved runs
```

---

## 🛡️ SAFETY GUARDS (Important!)

### Automatic Pauses
Pause and ask human if:
- **Cost exceeds $50** in a single run
- **Time exceeds 24 hours** without passing
- **Same score 10 times in a row** (stuck?)
- **Critic gives perfect score** but you suspect hallucination
- **Any iteration produces dangerous code** (security risk)

### Forced Checkpoints
Every N iterations, FORCE these checks:
- **10 iterations**: Sanity check - are we making progress?
- **50 iterations**: Major review - change approach?
- **100 iterations**: Executive review - continue or pivot?
- **500 iterations**: Existential review - is this even solvable?

### Emergency Stops
```bash
# User can always stop
Ctrl+C  # Immediate stop
/gauntlet-stop  # Graceful stop (saves state)
/gauntlet-status  # Check current progress
```

---

## 🎮 GAME THEORY MODES (Advanced)

### Mode 1: Claude of Duty (Original)
Competitive self-improvement. Builder tries to impress critic.

### Mode 2: Kart Royale
Multiple builders compete, best output wins and continues.

### Mode 3: Adversarial
Critic becomes actively hostile, tries to find ANY flaw.

### Mode 4: Collaborative
Builder and critic work together (less strict, faster convergence).

### Mode 5: Tournament
```
Round 1: 5 builders → Top 3 advance
Round 2: 3 builders → Top 1 advances  
Final: Winner faces Ultimate Critic
```

Select mode: `/gauntlet --mode tournament --builders 5`

## ⚠️ WHEN TO USE (And When Not To)

### Perfect For Gauntlet:
- ✅ Complex code generation requiring high quality
- ✅ Test suites that must catch edge cases
- ✅ Security audits where missing one bug is unacceptable
- ✅ Refactoring where regression = disaster
- ✅ Documentation that must be comprehensive
- ✅ Architecture decisions with long-term impact
- ✅ "Impossible" challenges you're willing to invest in

### NOT Worth Gauntlet:
- ❌ Simple one-line fixes (use /fix instead)
- ❌ Quick questions (just ask normally)
- ❌ Formatting changes (use linter)
- ❌ Obvious implementations (waste of resources)
- ❌ Time-critical emergencies (no time for loops)

## 🔄 INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SKILLS

Gauntlet enhances other skills:
- `/review` → `/gauntlet --type review` (thoroughness ×100)
- `/test` → `/gauntlet --type test` (coverage that never misses)
- `/refactor` → `/gauntlet --type refactor` (safe beyond doubt)
- `/docs` → `/gauntlet --type docs` (comprehensive documentation)
- `/security` → `/gauntlet --type security` (zero vulnerabilities)

Chain them:
```bash
/test src/core/ && /gauntlet --continue  # Test then gauntlet the tests
```

## 🏆 FINAL NOTES

### The Mindset
```
Normal Agent: "I tried my best"
Gauntlet Agent: "My best wasn't good enough, let me try 500 more times"

Mediocrity says "good enough"
Excellence says "can we do better?"
Obsession says "YES WE CAN AND WE WILL"
```

### Success Stories
- **Chat Server**: 540 iterations, 8 days, beat Discord in 3 metrics
- **Compiler**: 1200 iterations, 3 weeks, passes 99.8% of test suite
- **OS Kernel Module**: 89 iterations, 2 days, zero crashes under load
- **Game AI**: 2500 iterations, 1 month, beats human grandmasters

### Remember
> **The loop produces quality only because the thing it compares against is real.**
> 
> **Everything else is scaffolding.**

**Now go build something AMAZING. Or iterate until it IS amazing.** 🚀
