## Quick Start

```bash
# In XHE Web UI or CLI, use:
/review          # Review current changes
/test            # Generate tests for selected file
/commit          # Auto-generate commit message
/gauntlet        # Run quality loop on current task
/debug           # Debug the current issue
```

## Individual Skill Documentation

Each skill has its own detailed documentation:
- See `commands/` for slash command implementations
- See `gauntlet-loop/` for the Builder-Critic pattern
- See `testing/` for testing workflows
- See `git-workflow/` for Git automation
- See `documentation/` for doc generation
- See `refactoring/` for safe code changes
- See `debugging/` for issue resolution
- See `security/` for vulnerability scanning
- See `optimization/` for performance tuning

## Integration Notes

These skills work with XHE's native:
- **Skill System**: Auto-discovered via `.agents/skills/`
- **Command Registry**: Registered as slash commands via `ctx.commands`
- **Tool Pipeline**: Uses existing shell/fs/web tools
- **Session Log**: All actions logged for replay

## Quality Guarantees

Every skill follows XHE conventions:
- ✅ Defensive patterns applied
- ✅ Session events emitted
- ✅ Model-visible = logged invariant
- ✅ Abort signal handling
- ✅ Error boundaries respected
